# HelloWorldFluttertest

A **fun Flutter demo** that displays `"Hello World"` and a spinning skull GIF.

This project isn’t just testing Flutter — it’s a small showcase of **text + animation** in Flutter.

## What Users See

- The classic **Hello World** text
- A **spinning skull GIF** for dramatic flair
- Works on all Flutter-supported platforms (mobile, web, desktop)

It’s playful, minimal, and a nice visual introduction to Flutter widgets and asset handling.

## Features

- Text rendering in Flutter
- GIF animation via Flutter assets
- Cross-platform support (mobile, web, desktop)
- Easy to read and modify

## How It Works

- The `Text` widget displays “Hello World”
- The GIF is included in `assets/` and displayed using Flutter’s `Image.asset`
- Basic Flutter setup (pubspec.yaml includes assets)
